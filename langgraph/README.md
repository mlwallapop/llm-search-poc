# 🌐 LangGraph: Advanced LLM Orchestration and Agent Frameworks

Welcome to the LangGraph section! Here you'll find advanced demonstrations and frameworks designed to orchestrate and manage powerful Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents and workflows.

## 🚀 What's Inside?

### 🛠️ CodeAct Agent

- **Dynamic Code Execution:** Enables LLMs to dynamically generate and execute Python code, facilitating powerful automation and complex task handling.
- **Interactive Exploration:** Ideal for tasks requiring custom logic and Python-based integrations within conversational interfaces.

### 🌱 Data Enrichment Agent

- **Automated Data Processing:** Automatically enrich, classify, and structure your data using intelligent LLM-driven workflows.
- **Contextual Understanding:** Extract meaningful insights from data, categorize information, and enhance content through context-aware processing.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure your environment has all required packages installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Run LangGraph:** Start experimenting from the project's root:

```bash
langgraph dev
```

## 📁 Directory Structure

- **`codeact/`:** Contains implementations and examples demonstrating dynamic code execution.
- **`data-enrichment-agent-python/`:** Contains scripts and configurations for intelligent data enrichment workflows.
