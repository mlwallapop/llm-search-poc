# 📒 Interactive Notebooks for LLM Exploration

Welcome to your collection of interactive notebooks! Here you’ll find hands-on examples designed to help you understand, experiment with, and master various aspects of Large Language Models (LLMs) integration and orchestration.

## 🗂️ Notebooks Overview

Each notebook focuses on a key area of LLM-powered applications:

- **💬 Chat Models:**
  Learn about conversational models, their capabilities, and how to integrate them into your applications.

- **🧑‍💻 Prompt Engineering:**
  Explore techniques to craft effective prompts that yield accurate and reliable LLM responses.

- **🔎 Retrieval and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation):**
  Delve into advanced retrieval techniques and integrate external knowledge sources to enhance LLM outputs.

- **🗃️ Embedding Models:**
  Understand how embedding models capture semantic meanings and enable similarity-based retrieval.

- **📐 Vector Stores:**
  Discover how to store and retrieve embeddings efficiently to power semantic searches and RAG systems.

- **🛠️ Tools and Utilities:**
  Learn about tools to improve your workflow, from managing APIs to handling data transformations.

- **📏 Text Splitters:**
  Master techniques to split and manage large text datasets effectively for processing by LLMs.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Ensure your environment is running:

- Start your notebook server with Docker (if not already running):

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

- Access your notebooks at: [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888)

## 🧑‍🔬 Experiment and Explore

Each notebook is interactive—experiment, tweak, and see immediate results. Feel free to copy, adapt, and integrate examples into your own projects!
